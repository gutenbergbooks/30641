<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>ARABIAN TALES AND THEIR SOURCES.</h3>

  <p>The Arabians have been the immediate instruments in transmitting to us
  those Oriental tales, of which the conception is so brilliant, and the
  character so rich and varied, and which, after having been the delight of
  our childhood, never lose entirely the spell of their enchantment over
  our maturer age. But while many of these tales are doubtless of Arabian
  origin, it is not to be supposed that all are equally so. If we may
  believe the French translator of the <i>Thousand and One Tales</i>, that
  publication does not include the thirty-sixth part of the great Arabian
  collection, which is not confined to books, but has been the traditional
  inheritance of a numerous class, who, like the minstrels of the West,
  gained their livelihood by reciting, what would interest the feelings of
  their hearers. This class of Eastern story-tellers was common throughout
  the whole extent of Mahomedan dominion in Turkey, Persia, and even to the
  extremity of India.</p>

  <p>The sudden rise of the Saracen empire, and its rapid transition from
  barbarism to refinement, and from the deepest ignorance to the most
  extensive cultivation of literature and science, is an extraordinary
  phenomenon in the history of mankind. A century scarcely elapsed from the
  age of Amrou, the general of Caliph Omar, who is said to have burned the
  great Alexandrian library, to the period when the family of the
  Abbasides, who mounted the throne of the Caliphs <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 750, introduced a passionate love of art,
  science, and even poetry. The celebrated Haroun Al Raschid never took a
  journey without at least a hundred men of science in his train. But the
  most munificent patron of Arabic literature was Al Mamoun, the seventh
  Caliph of the race of the Abbasides, and son of Haroun Al Raschid. Having
  succeeded to the throne <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 813, he rendered
  Bagdad the centre of literature: collecting from the subject provinces of
  Syria, Armenia, and Egypt the most important books which could be
  discovered, as the most precious tribute that could be rendered, and
  causing them to be translated into Arabic for general use. When Al Mamoun
  dictated the terms of peace to Michael, the Greek emperor, the tribute
  which he demanded from him was a collection of Greek authors.</p>

  <p>The Arabian tales had their birth after this period; and when the
  Arabians had yielded to the Tartars, Turks, and Persians, the empire of
  the sword. Soldiers are seldom introduced; the splendours of the just
  Caliph's reign are dwelt upon with fond remembrance; the style is that of
  a mercantile people, while riches and artificial luxuries are only
  rivalled by the marvellous gifts of the genii and fairies. This brilliant
  mythology, the offspring of the Arabian imagination, together with the
  other characteristics of the Arabian tales, has had an extensive
  influence on our own literature. Many of these tales had found their way
  into our poetry long before the translation of the <i>Arabian Nights</i>;
  and are met with in the old <i>Fabliaux</i>, and in Boccacio, Ariosto,
  and Chaucer. But while these tales are Arabian in their structure, the
  materials have been derived, not only from India, Persia, and China, but
  also from ancient Egypt, and the classical literature of Greece.</p>

  <p>I shall content myself at present with adducing one example of such
  probable derivation from the source last mentioned. The stories to be
  compared are too long for quotation, which, as they are well known, will
  not be necessary. I shall therefore merely give, in parallel columns, the
  numerous points of resemblance, or coincidence, between the two. The
  Arabian tale is that of "Ali Baba and the Forty Robbers;" the
  corresponding story will be found in Herodotus, b. <span
  class="scac">II</span>. c. cxxi.; it is that of Rhampsinitus and the
  robbery of his royal treasury:</p>

<h3>LA ROCHEFOUCAULD.</h3>

  <p>Meeting occasionally, in reading new French works and journals, with
  sentiments and criticisms by eminent living writers on the characteristic
  peculiarities of some of the most distinguished French authors of the age
  of Louis XIV. and subsequently, perhaps you will allow me to send you,
  from time to time, "notes" or extracts from the criticisms alluded to, in
  case you should be of opinion that they may be agreeable to some of your
  readers, who may not be aware of the healthier and more Christian tone
  that now pervades one, at least, of the most influential organs of public
  opinion in France. Let us begin with <i>La Rochefoucauld</i>, as recently
  reviewed in the <i>Journal des Débats</i>.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">J. Macray.</span></p>

  <p class="address">Oxford.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

<p class="cenhead"><i>"La Rochefoucauld.</i></p>

  <p>"Pourquoi La Rochefoucauld m'inspire-t-il une répugnance invincible?
  Pourquoi cette souffrance en le lisant? Ah! le voici, je crois. La morale
  de La Rochefoucauld c'est la morale Chrétienne, moins, si je puis
  m'exprimer ainsi, le Christianisme lui-même; c'est tout ce qui peut
  humilier et abattre le c&oelig;ur dans la sévère doctrine de l'Evangile,
  moins ce qui le relève; c'est toutes les illusions détruites sans les
  espérances qui remplacent les illusions. En un mot, dans le Christianisme
  La Rochefoucauld n'a pris que le dogme de la chute; il a laissé le dogme
  de la rédemption. En faisant briller un côté du flambeau, celui qui
  désenchante l'homme de lui-même, il éclipse l'autre, celui qui montre à
  l'homme dans le ciel sa force, son appui, et l'espoir d'une régénération.
  La Rochefoucauld ne croit pas plus à la sainteté qu'à la sagesse, pas
  plus à Dieu qu'à l'homme. Le pénitent n'est pas moins vain à ses yeux que
  le philosophe. Partout l'orgueil, partout le <i>moi</i>, sous la haire du
  Trappiste, comme sous le manteau du cynique.</p>

  <p>"La Rochefoucauld n'est Chrétien que pour poursuivre notre pauvre
  c&oelig;ur jusque dans ses derniers retranchemens; il n'est Chrétien que
  pour verser son poison sur nos joies et sur nos rêves les plus chers....
  Que reste-t-il donc à l'homme? Pour les âmes fortes, il ne reste rien
  qu'un froid et intrépide mépris de toutes choses, un sec et stoïque
  contentement à envisager le néant absolu; pour les autres, le désespoir
  ou les jouissances brutales du plaisir comme dernière fin de la vie!</p>

  <p>"Et voilà ce que je déteste dans La Rochefoucauld! Cet idéal dont j'ai
  soif, il le détruit partout. Ce bien, ce beau, dont les faibles images me
  ravissent encore sous la forme imparfaite de nos vertus, de notre
  science, de notre sagesse humaine, il le réduit à un sec
  intérêt."&mdash;S. De Sacy, <i>Journal des Débats</i>, Janv. 28.</p>

<h3>SHROPSHIRE BALLAD.</h3>

  <p>Your correspondent B. H. C. (Vol. viii., p.&nbsp;614.) gives, from
  recollection, a Northamptonshire version of the old "Ballad of Sir Hugh
  of Lincoln." It reminded me of a similar, though somewhat varied, version
  which I took down, more than forty years ago, from the lips of a
  nurse-maid in Shropshire. It may interest the author of <i>The Celt, the
  Roman, and the Saxon</i>, to know that it was recited in the place of his
  birth. Its resemblance to the ballad in Percy's <i>Reliques</i> was my
  inducement to commit it to paper:</p>

  <div class="poem">

      <p>It hails, it rains, both great and small,</p>

      <p>They have need to play at ball.</p>
      <p>They toss'd the ball so high,</p>
      <p>They toss'd the ball so low,</p>
      <p>Amongst all the Jews' cattle</p>
      <p>And amongst the Jews below.</p>
      <p>Out came one of the Jews' daughters</p>
      <p>Dressed all in green.</p>
      <p>"Come, my sweet Saluter,</p>
      <p>And fetch the ball again."</p>
      <p>"I durst not come, I must not come,</p>
      <p>Unless all my little playfellows come along,</p>
      <p>For if my mother sees me at the gate,</p>
      <p>She'll cause my blood to fall."</p>
      <p>She show'd me an apple as green as grass,</p>
      <p>She show'd me a gay gold ring,</p>
      <p>She show'd me a cherry as red as blood,</p>
      <p>And so she entic'd me in.</p>
      <p>She took me in the parlour,</p>
      <p>She took me in the kitchen,</p>
      <p>And there I saw my own dear nurse</p>
      <p>A picking of a chicken.</p>
      <p>She laid me down to sleep,</p>
      <p>With a Bible at my head, and a Testament at my feet;</p>

<h3>"OF THE BENEFIT OF THE DEATH OF CHRIST,"
BY AONIO PALEARIO.</h3>

  <p>The total, or almost total, disappearance of books at one time largely
  circulated, is a curious fact in the history of literature. One cause of
  it may be found in the efforts made by the Church of Rome to suppress
  those works which were supposed to contain unsound doctrine.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Heretical books," says Mr. T. B. Macaulay, "were sought out and
  destroyed with unsparing rigour. Works which were once in every house,
  were so effectually suppressed, that no copy of them is now to be found
  in the most extensive libraries. One book in particular, entitled <i>Of
  the Benefit of the Death of Christ</i>, had this fate. It was written in
  Tuscan, was many times reprinted, and was eagerly read in every part of
  Italy. But the inquisitors detected in it the Lutheran doctrine of
  justification by faith alone. <i>They proscribed it; and it is now as
  utterly lost as the second decade of Livy.</i>"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This book was published without a name. But the author was Aonio
  Paleario. It was translated into various languages, as French, Spanish,
  English, and possibly others; and within six years after its first
  appearance, 40,000 copies are said to have been circulated.</p>

  <p>A few years ago I was fortunate enough to meet with a copy of the
  English version, which was made from the French, not from the original.
  This copy was printed in 1638, and was, according to the title-page, the
  fourth (English) edition. From it I edited the work, prefixing a short
  notice of the author, and verifying the references to the Fathers. It was
  subsequently retranslated into Italian, and has, I am informed, been much
  read in Italy. Some time after this publication, I became aware of the
  existence of a copy (in private hands) of the apparently first English
  edition, bearing the date of 1573. This I was allowed to inspect: and I
  hope hereafter to put forth another edition, in which the text of this
  copy will be followed, and two or three inaccuracies which had crept into
  the former impression will be corrected.</p>

  <p>I was, however, ignorant that a single copy of the original Italian
  existed; and all inquiry for it seemed to be vain. But one was near at
  hand, preserved with diligent care among the literary treasures of St.
  John's College, Cambridge, by the authorities there, who were well aware
  of its rarity and value. By their obliging permission, I was a few days
  ago permitted to examine it.</p>

  <p>It is a small square 16mo., bound, in beautiful condition, measuring
  about 4¼ inches by 3, and containing seventy-two pages. The following is
  the title-page:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Trattato vtilissimo del beneficio di Giesv Christo crocifisso, verso
  i Christiani. Venetiis, Apud Bernardinum de Bindonis. Anno Do. <span
  class="scac">M.D.XXXXIII</span>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>From the date, it seems to be the first edition.</p>

  <p>There is an address</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

<p class="cenhead">"Alli Lettori Christiani.</p>

  <p>"Essendoci venuta alle mani un' opera delle piu pie e dotte, che a
  nostri tempi si siano fatte, il titolo della quale e, Del beneficio di
  Giesu Christo crocifisso verso i Christiani: ci e paruto a consolatione e
  utilita vostra darla &#x12B; istampa, e senza il nome dello scrittore,
  accioche piu la cosa vi muova, che l' autorita dell' autore."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This most curious volume has been for upwards of a century in the
  library of St. John's College, as the following printed notice, pasted
  within the cover, will show:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In grati animi testificationem, ob plurima Humanitatis officia, a
  Collegio Divi Joannis Evangelistæ apud Cantabrigienses multifariam
  collata, librum hunc inter alios lectissimos eidem collegio legavit
  Illustrissimus Vir, Dominicus Antonius Ferrari, J.&nbsp;U.&nbsp;D. Neapolitanus,
  1744.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i8hg3">"Teste,</p>
      <p class="i10hg3">"<span class="sc">J. Creyk.</span>"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

</blockquote>

  <p>But this is not all. The College is happy enough to possess a copy of
  the rare French translation of the same book. This is somewhat larger in
  size than the original Italian, and consists of sixty-four leaves. It
  contains, as will be seen by the title-page, some additional matter:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Dv benefice de Iesvs Christ crvcifie, envers les Chrestiens. Traduict
  de vulgaire Italien, en langage Françoys. Plus, Vne Traduction de la
  huytiesme Homelie de sainct Iean Chrysostome, De la femme Cananée: mise
  de Latin en Françoys. Venez a moy vous tous qui trauaillez et estes
  chargez, et ie vous soulageray, 1552."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>There is an address by the French translator: "Le traducteur a tous
  les Chrestiens qui sont dessoubz le ciel, Salut;" and at the end of the
  volume is a "Traduction du Psalme xxxiv." The French version is said to
  have been first published in 1545. This therefore is not, it would seem,
  the earliest edition.</p>

  <p>This volume also, it may be added, was given to the College by
  Ferrari.</p>

<h2>Minor Notes.</h2>

  <p><i>Stone Chisels.</i>&mdash;I saw recently an oviform stone implement
  which had been found on the granite moors of North Cornwall, and
  apparently had been used as a pickaxe in mining. The following notice
  shows that such implements were used by the ancient miners in the Lake
  Superior district:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The explorers are now much aided by these guiding features, also by
  pits, which indicate where an ancient race&mdash;probably the Aztecs or
  Toltecs&mdash;have carried on their superficial operations on the veins.
  Some of those I saw were twenty or thirty feet deep, which <!-- Page 322
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page322"></a>{322}</span>must have been
  the result of much labour, considering their tools&mdash;<i>the only
  trace of which we find in the shape of oviformed stones, with a groove
  round the centre for the purpose of securing a handle</i>, then to be
  used as a hammer to shatter the vein-stone after it probably had been
  reduced by the action of fire and water on the calcareous matter entering
  into its composition. In favour of this conjecture, quantities of
  charcoal have been found in the bottom of some of these pits, which are
  almost effaced by the accumulation of timber decayed and foliage of ages
  past."&mdash;From a letter in the <i>Mining Journal</i>, Jan. 7,

  <p><i>Fleas and Bugs.</i>&mdash;Has the following explanation of an old

  on which, the insect might find good entertainment&mdash;a plentiful
  board, as well as a snug lodging. It appears, however, that the name has
  not long been applied to the <i>Cimex</i>, so that the saying may be of

  picture?&mdash;I reply in the words of the painter Zeuxis, when the same
  question was addressed to him on exhibiting his master-piece of imitative
  art: 'The curtain <i>is</i> the picture.'"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Compare this with Pliny, <i>Nat. Hist.</i> <span

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Arch. Weir.</span></p>

  <p><i>Cure for Hydrophobia.</i>&mdash;A gentleman named Monsell, who
  lived at Kilrush in the county Clare, possessed a cure for hydrophobia
  which was never known to fail. He required that the patient should be
  brought to him within nine days from the time of being bitten, and his
  first proceeding was to cause the person to look in a looking-glass or
  pail of water: if the patient bore that trial without showing any
  uneasiness, he declared that there was no doubt of his being able to
  effect a cure. He then retired to another room, leaving the patient alone
  for a short time; and when he returned, he brought two bits of cheese
  which he said contained the remedy, and caused the person to swallow
  them. He then desired that the patient should return home, and for nine
  days frequently drink a few sips of water; and also take opportunities to
  look at water or a looking-glass, so as to accustom the nerves to be
  under control. I knew a case of a peasant girl, who was bitten by a mad
  dog, and who had to be brought to him tied on a car, whom he cured. The
  dog, before he was killed, bit several valuable dogs, all of <!-- Page
  323 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page323"></a>{323}</span>which had
  to be destroyed; he also bit two pigs, which, after showing most
  frightful symptoms of hydrophobia, had to be shot and their flesh burned.
  Mr. Monsell always refused to declare what his remedy was, "lest it might
  be used for anything but a human being." It would appear that in a great
  measure he worked on the imagination of his patients: still some other
  means may have been used, and, as he has been dead some time, it is to be
  hoped he did not let his secret die with him. He never would take any
  remuneration from those he cured, or their friends. I never heard any
  person in that part of the country express the least doubt of the
  efficacy of the remedy he used.</p>

  Nicolai de lyra postilla Pauli Brug&#x113;sis Additi&#x14D;ibus Matthie
  Thoring Replicis</i>, in 6 volumes folio, printed at Basle in the years
  1506-8. The binding is of oak boards and calf leather, stamped with a
  very spirited design composed of foliated borders, surrounding, on the
  right cover, six impressions from a die three inches high by one and
  three quarters wide, consisting of a narrow border enclosing a human
  figure, who bears in his left hand a knotted staff as high as himself,
  while in the right he holds a bag or scrip containing many balls (perhaps
  stones or fruit), which hangs over his shoulder. Under the right arm he
  carries a sword, and on the wrist a wicker basket. The lower limbs of
  this strange being are clad in loose garments, like to a modern pair of
  trousers, with a large ragged hole on each knee. The feet are not seen,
  as he is behind a fence composed of interlaced branches of trees. To
  complete the picture, the head, which is much too large for the body, has
  no other covering but crisped hair.</p>

  <p>On the left cover are four impressions of a die three inches high by
  two wide, on which are six animals whose kinds it is difficult to
  determine with certainty; the two upper possibly may be horses, the
  middle a bird and a monkey, the lower a lion and a dog. The animals are
  separated from each other by a running pattern composed of branches,
  leaves, and flowers, and are surrounded by a frame, on which is the
  following in black-letter:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"DEUS DET NOBIS SUAM PACEM</p>
      <p>ET POST MORTEM UITAM ETERNAM."</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>On the title-page, slightly varied in each volume, is the following
  inscription, in a hand not much later than the publication of the
  book:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Liber M. Joachimi Moller ex testamento M. Johan&#x12B;s vam mer optim
  et maximus deus illius anime misereatur. Amen."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I shall be much obliged to any one who will explain to me the figures
  on the cover, which, doubtless, have some legendary or symbolic meaning;
  and also give me any notes or references concerning either of the former
  possessors of the book, both of whom have, I believe, enriched it with
  manuscript notes.</p>

<h2>Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>Barristers' Gowns.</i>&mdash;What is the meaning of the lapel, or
  piece which hangs from the back of the barristers' gown? Has it any
  particular name? In shape it is very similar to the representations we
  see in pictures of the "cloven tongues." It is not improbable that it may
  be intended figuratively to bear reference to them.</p>

  Dictionary</i> (ed. 1727), under the word <span class="sc">Lusgul</span>,
  I find the following reference: "Charta Hen. 2. G.&nbsp;G. n.&nbsp;2. q." I should
  be much obliged to any person who would suggest for what "G.&nbsp;G. n.&nbsp;2. q."
  stands.</p>

  <p><i>Albany Wallace.</i>&mdash;Can any of your correspondents, familiar
  with the drama, tell me who this gentleman was? In 1827, there appeared
  <i>The Death of Mary Queen of Scots</i>, an historic drama in five acts,
  by A.&nbsp;W., Esq.: Worthing, printed for the author by W. Verrall. His name
  occurs again on the title-page of <i>The Reigns of the Stuarts in England
  dramatised. The First Part of King James the First</i>, a play in five
  acts: London, printed by the author, at his private press, Queen Ann
  Street, 1835.</p>

  <p>I naturally turned up Mr. Martin's <i>Privately Printed Books</i>, but
  neither our dramatist nor his press is there alluded to. Touching the
  latter, Mr. Wallace says in his preface,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A certain picture was said by a connoisseur to be 'very well painted
  for a <i>gentleman!</i>' a species of <!-- Page 324 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page324"></a>{324}</span>negative praise which
  gave but little satisfaction to the artist. Should the amateur printer,
  however, meet with as much, he will be very well contented. All he can
  himself say for his work is 'that it is legible;' and his type being of a
  pretty tolerable rotundity, he does not think it will need an additional
  pair of spectacles to be made out."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I am farther desirous of knowing if, in pursuance of his plan, Mr.
  Wallace <i>dramatised</i> any more of the Stuarts?</p>

  <p><i>Leslie and Dr. Middleton.</i>&mdash;In Dr. M&lsquo;Neile's
  <i>Lecture on the Jews and Judaism</i>, Feb. 14, 1854, the four rules
  given by Leslie as a test of historical truth are thus quoted:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"1. That the matter of fact be such that men's outward senses, their
  ears and eyes, may be judges of it.</p>

  <p>"2. That it be done publicly, in the face of the world.</p>

  <p>"3. That not only public monuments be kept in memory of it, but also
  that some outward actions be statedly performed.</p>

  <p>"4. That such observances be instituted, and do commence, from the
  time at which such matter of fact is done.</p>

  <p>"<i>It is said</i> that Dr. Middleton endeavoured for twenty years to
  find out some pretended fact to which Mr. Leslie's four rules could be
  applied, but in vain."</p>

  <p><i>Star and Garter, Kirkstall.</i>&mdash;What is <i>now</i> a large
  hotel, at Kirkstall Bridge, near to Kirkstall Abbey in Yorkshire, was
  many years ago a mere village roadside hostel, under whose sign (the Star
  and Garter) was inscribed in Greek capitals "<span title="TO PREPON" class="grk"
  >&Tau;&Omicron; &Pi;&Rho;&Epsilon;&Pi;&Omicron;&Nu;</span>." How could
  such an inscription have got into such a place? Could it have been the
  suggestion of some "learned clerke" of the neighbouring monastery, as
  more suited to the genius of the vicinity than the ordinary announcement
  of "Good Entertainment for Man and Horse?"</p>

  <p><i>Shrove Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Happening to be at Newbury on Shrove
  Tuesday, I was struck with the tolling of the church bell as for a death,

  this day. Does such a custom exist anywhere else, and what is the origin

  <p>"<i>Tarbox for that.</i>"&mdash;On reading a book of funny stories
  some years ago in the British Museum (a sort of <i>Joe Miller</i> of
  Charles II.'s time), whenever any story was given that seemed "too good
  to be true," the anecdote ended with the words "Tarbox for that." Am I
  right in suspecting that this is equivalent to the expression, "Tell that
  to the marines," so well known in our day? "Tarbox" was probably a
  nickname for a bumpkin, or guardian of the tarbox, in which was kept the
  tar composition used for anointing sheep. Can anybody suggest another
  solution of the meaning of this expression?</p>

  <p><i>Christmas Ballad.</i>&mdash;Perhaps some of your correspondents may

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Twelve is twelve as goes to hell,</p>
      <p>Eleven is eleven as goes to heaven,</p>
      <p>Ten is the Ten Commandments,</p>
      <p>Nine is nine so bright to shine,</p>

  of the Western Church; but if the Emperor Nicholas, in his famous
  manifesto (vide Vol. viii., pp. 585. 655.), quotes from this hymn and not
  from the Psalms, the one being quite as likely as the other, it would
  almost appear that the Latin version is the one with which he is the most
  familiar.</p>

  the church porch his temporary home until he can find a lodging
  elsewhere. Is this a fact? In the parish register of Flamstead, Herts, is

  <p><i>Inscription on the Brass of Sir G. Felbrigge.</i>&mdash;Can any of
  your numerous correspondents afford me an explanation of the following
  fragment of an inscription from the brass of Sir George Felbrigge,
  Playford, Suffolk? Each word is separated by the letter <a
  href="images/oldem.png"><img src="images/oldem.png" class="middle"
  style="height:2ex" alt="Old English M" /></a>, and a demi-rose conjoined.
  The part enclosed in brackets is now lost, but was remaining in Gough's
  time:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Funda de per a dieu loange et dieu pur lalme de lui al [dieu quil est
  pete ei(t) ceste]."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This is the order in which the words now stand; but as they are quite
  unintelligible, and the fillet shows evident signs of having been broken
  in several places, we may reasonably suppose that they were misplaced
  when the brass was moved from its original slab. The principal word,
  about which I am in difficulty, is <i>pete</i>. Can it be the same as
  "pitië?" If so, I venture to suggest the following explanation, till some
  one may offer me a better:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>The following notice of the destruction of this beautiful brass is

  covered by the pews, was three or four years ago, in consequence of some
  repairs, uncovered, when the incumbent and his curate had it torn from
  the stone, and it was for some time lying in pieces at the mercy of any
  pilferer. Mr. Albert Way, the Director of the Society of Antiquaries in
  Feb. 1844, wrote to me, to ask what was become of the figure; and, in
  consequence, as I had not an opportunity of visiting the church myself, I
  wrote to Mr. Arthur Biddell for information; and the following is a copy
  of his answer, dated Feb. 23, 1844: 'Felbrigge's monument was removed,
  much against my wishes, from its former place in the N.&nbsp;E. corner of the
  church to the chancel under the communion table, where it is fixed;
  forming part of the pavement. The broken pieces of brass are again fixed
  in the stone; but so many of the pieces were long ago lost, and I think
  those which were lately separated from the stone are not placed in their
  original position: so, except the figure, there is little remains to
  convey an idea of the ornamental and beautiful work by which the figure
  was surrounded.'"]</p>

  obtained, jointly with Sir Thomas Walsingham, Knt., a grant of lands in
  the counties of Leicester, Derby, &amp;c.; in 1631 a grant of free-warren
  for his lands in Leicestershire; in 1636 was high sheriff for the county;
  and in 1637 certain amerciaments against him on account of that office,
  which had been returned into the Court of Chancery, were certified to the
  Court of Exchequer. Heartily espousing the cause of Charles I., he was
  one of the Commissioners of Array for this county, and on May 28, 1645,
  had the honour of entertaining his sovereign at Cotes, after which he was
  fined 1114<i>l.</i> by the parliamentary sequestrators. He was the last
  of the family who resided at Cotes; and amongst his poems is "An Elegy on
  the Death of my never enough lamented master, King Charles I." The others
  are chiefly of a melancholy turn. Sir Henry, his second son, died soon
  after his father, unmarried; whereupon his title and estate went to his
  next brother Sir Gray, who, after the death of the king, went with
  several other gentlemen, to avoid the usurpation, over to Virginia, and

  <p><i>Origin of Clubs.</i>&mdash;Can any of your correspondents inform me

  <p class="author">F. R. B.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[Club is defined by Johnson to be "an assembly of good fellows,
  meeting under certain conditions." The present system of clubs may be
  traced in its progressive steps from those small associations, meeting
  (as clubs of a lower grade still do) at a house of public entertainment;
  then we come to a time when the club took exclusive possession of the
  house, and strangers could be only introduced, under regulations, by the
  members; in the third stage, the clubs build houses, or rather palaces,
  for themselves. The club at the Mermaid Tavern in Friday Street was,
  according to all accounts, the first select company established, and owed
  its origin to Sir Walter Raleigh, who had here instituted a meeting of
  men of wit and genius, previously to his engagement with the unfortunate
  Cobham. This society comprised all that the age held most distinguished
  for learning and talent, numbering amongst its members Shakspeare, Ben
  Jonson, Beaumont and Fletcher, Selden, Sir Walter Raleigh, Donne, Cotton,
  Carew, Martin, and many others. There it was that the "wit-combats" took
  place between Shakspeare and Ben Johson, to which, probably, Beaumont
  alludes with so much affection in his letter to the old poet, written
  from the country:</p>

      <p>Had meant to put his whole wit in a jest."</p>
    </div>

  <p>Ben Jonson had another club, of which he appears to have been the
  founder, held in a room of the old Devil Tavern, distinguished by the
  name of the "Apollo." It stood between the Temple Gates and Temple Bar.
  It was for this Club that Jonson wrote the "Leges Convivales," printed
  among his works.]</p>

<h3>MARMORTINTO, OR SAND-PAINTING.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ix., p.&nbsp;217.)</p>

  <p>Mr. Haas, a native of Bibrach, in Germany, was accustomed to lay claim
  to the invention of sand-painting; and would often with a little pride
  repeat to his friends the way in which it was first suggested to his
  mind. Simply this:&mdash;Once, while he was engaged ornamenting a plateau
  with an elaborate and rich design, King George III. entered the
  apartment; and after having regarded the design and <i>modum operandi</i>
  for some considerable time in silence, exclaimed, in an impatient manner,
  as if vexed that so much beauty should be so short-lived: "Haas! Haas!
  you ought to fasten it." From that moment, the artist turned his
  ingenuity to the subject: and how successfully, his pictures show.</p>

  <p>The remarks of F. C. H. as to the mode of painting are quite correct.
  The fixing of the <!-- Page 328 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page328"></a>{328}</span>sand was the last operation, inasmuch as I
  have heard of the artist's wrath visiting a poor pussy because she had
  shaken a picture, and thereby disturbed the sand not yet fixed. The
  secret died with him and a friend, a contemporaneous artist, to whom I
  believe he had communicated the secret; this friend's name I do not know.
  Mr. Haas painted landscapes, the friend painted cattle pieces. I have in
  my possession some of Mr. Haas' work. It is beautifully soft and quiet.
  The foliage is fine in the extreme, withal a rich depth of colouring. The
  Welsh scenery he felt most at home in, he threw into it a spirit of
  repose: while it was bold, there was nothing harsh or offensive to the
  eye. I have tried many experiments with one of this pictures: amongst
  other things, I find the least moisture will remove the sand. Mr. Haas
  had a gallery in London for some time (I believe in Regent Street), where
  there were portraits done in sand. A portrait of himself was considered
  the gem of the pictures: such a vitality and delicacy of colouring did it
  possess. I mention this merely to show that sand could be applied to
  other branches of art besides landscapes. The history of the pictures at
  Windsor Castle is to be seen in one of the old <i>Windsor Guides</i>. Mr.
  Hans died at Bibrach, where doubtless many of his pictures are.</p>

  <p>Sand-paintings cannot last long; they have in themselves the element
  of their own destruction, "their rough surface," which very soon collects
  and retains the dust. I never heard of their being cleaned.</p>

<h3>O'BRIEN OF THOSMOND.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ix., p.&nbsp;125.)</p>

  <p>In corroboration of my former suggestion, that Nicholas Thosmound of
  Somersetshire was an O'Brien of Thomond, I beg to add some farther facts.
  Cotemporary with him was William Toutmound, who obtained in the sixth
  year of Henry IV. a grant of the office (in England) of chief carpenter
  of the king for his life. This singular office, "Capitalis Carpentarius
  Regis," must, I suppose, be called Lord High Carpenter of England, in
  analogy with the offices of steward, butler, &amp;c. It is mentioned in
  the <i>Calendar of Patent Rolls of England</i> at the 6 Henry IV.; and in
  the same repository is mention of a grant long before by Henry III. of
  the land of Tosmond in Ireland, to A.&nbsp;R. Tosmond (R standing, I presume,
  for "Regi," for the Irish Toparchs were then thus designated by the
  English government). In this case then we have the letter <i>s</i> used
  for <i>t</i>, as in the <i>Inq. P.&nbsp;M.</i> of Alicia, wife of the
  before-mentioned Nicholas Thosmound. In the <i>Abbreviatio Rotulorum
  Originalium of England</i>, in 15 Edw. II., is the expression
  "Regalitatem de Totamon," applied to the district of Thomond in Ireland.
  It seems not unlikely that the two cotemporary individuals mentioned
  above were sons or grandsons of Turloch, or Tirrèlagh, O'Brien, sovereign
  of Thomond from 1367 to 1370, when he was supplanted by his nephew Brien
  O'Brien, ancestor of the Marquis of Thomond. For this Turloch was in some
  favour with the government, by whom his distress was sometimes relieved.
  Thus it appears from the printed calendar of Irish Chancery Rolls, that a
  writ of <i>liberate</i> issued in the 4th Rich. II. for the payment to
  him of forty marks; and again, 5 Rich. II., of twenty marks, "ei concord.
  p<span class="x1"><span class="x4">&#xAF;</span></span> recompens.
  labor." He was much befriended by the Earl of Desmond, whose successor
  being high in favour with the kings Henry V. and VI., obtained a large
  grant of land in the county of Waterford, which he immediately conferred
  on the sons of Turloch. Yet some of those sons may, through his interest,
  have been established in England. It becomes, therefore, a matter of
  considerable interest to ascertain whether the <i>Inq. P.&nbsp;M.</i> 2 Henry
  IV. contains any proof that Nicholas Thosmound was an O'Brien.</p>

  <p>While on this subject, may I inquire the reason why the O'Briens
  quarter with their own arms the bearing of three piles meeting in a
  point? These latter were the arms of the English baronial family of
  Bryan, not at all connected with the Irish family. I suspect the Irish
  were late in their assumption of arms, and borrowed in many cases the
  arms of English families of nearly similar names.</p>

<h3>CORONATION STONE.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ix., p.&nbsp;123.)</p>

  <p>Possibly the following authorities may tend to throw light upon the
  question started by your correspondent.</p>

  <p>In <i>Ant. Univ. Hist.</i>, vol. xvii. p.&nbsp;287., 4to. ed., London,
  1747, it is said:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"St. Austin tells us that some of the Carthaginian divinities had the
  name of Abaddires, and their priests that of Eucaddires. This class, in
  all probability, was derived from the stone which Jacob anointed with
  oil, after it had served him for a pillow the night he had his vision;
  for in the morning he called the place where he lay Bethel. Now it is no
  wonder this should have been esteemed as sacred, since God himself says,
  he was the <span class="sc">God of Bethel</span>, the place where Jacob
  anointed the pillar. From Bethel came the bætylus of Damascius, which we
  find called Abaddir by Priscian. This Abaddir is the Ph&oelig;nician
  Aban-dir, that is, the spherical stone, exactly answering to the
  description of the bætylus given us by Damascius and others. The case
  seems to have been this; the Canaanites of the neighbourhood first
  worshipped the individual stone itself, upon which Jacob had poured <!--
  Page 329 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page329"></a>{329}</span>oil;
  afterwards they consecrated others of that form, and worshipped them;
  which false worship was perpetuated even to the time of St.
  Austin."&mdash;See note (<span class="scac">N</span>), <i>Ant. Univ.
  Hist.</i>, vol. i. p.&nbsp;310.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Now if such stones were an object of worship among the
  Ph&oelig;nicians, nothing is more probable than that they should take
  such a stone along with them in their migrations to new settlements; and
  it may therefore well be that the Ph&oelig;nicians, who first settled in
  Ireland, did bring such a stone with them; and hence possibly the
  tradition in question may have originated.</p>

  <p>There is abundant evidence that the Ph&oelig;nicians fled from
  Palestine in very early times (<i>Ant. Univ. Hist.</i>, vol. iii.
  p.&nbsp;479.), and probably some of the Jews also about the time when Samaria
  was taken; and there can be no doubt that some Ph&oelig;nicians, if not
  some Jews, settled in these islands at a very remote period; and it is a
  very remarkable fact that the Welsh spoken in North Wales is said to be
  nearer to the old Hebrew than any other existing language, and varying no
  more from it than the great length of time which has passed would lead
  any one to expect. (<i>Ant. Univ. Hist.</i>, vol. vi. p.&nbsp;31. note.)</p>

  <p>It should seem that some at least of the bætyli were round, and of
  such a size that they might be carried about by their votaries either by
  hanging at the neck or in some other way (<i>Ant. Univ. Hist.</i>, vol.
  xvii. p.&nbsp;287. <i>x.</i>). But probably they were originally in the shape
  of a pillow. In Gen. xxviii. 18., it is said that Jacob "took the stone
  that he had put for his pillow, and set it up for a pillar, and poured
  oil upon the top of it;" from which it is plain that the stone was not a
  sphere, but oblong and flat at the top and bottom; and probably not with
  square edges, as that would be most uncomfortable to lay the head upon.<a

  <p class="author">S. G. C.</p>

<div class="note">
  <a name="footnote4"></a><b>Footnote 4:</b><a
  href="#footnotetag4">(return)</a>
  <p>Query whether from these bætyli our ancestors derived the word
  <i>beetle</i>, which denotes a wooden maul or hammer for driving wedges.
  Its head is about a foot long, flat at each end, and the rest round; so
  that it nearly resembles a pillow in shape, and the head, together with
  its handle, would well resemble a stone of similar shape suspended by a
  cord in the middle. Bailey derives the word in this sense, and as
  denoting the insect, from Sax. <a href="images/232_bytel.png"><img
  src="images/232_bytel.png" class="middle" style="height:2ex" alt="Bytel"
  /></a>. If a handle was ever put in a bætylus, which was of the form I
  have suggested, it would form an excellent instrument for driving wedges
  or the like.</p>

  <p>Thirty years ago, the coronation stone in Westminster Abbey stood
  under a very old chair; and was a bluish irregular block of stone,
  similar both in colour and shape to stepping-stones in the shallow rivers
  of the north of England. It is <i>now</i> a very nice hewn block, nicely
  fitted into the frame under the seat of a renovated chair. It does not
  look at all like the old stone of former days. Is the geological
  formation of the present block very difficult to ascertain?</p>

<h3>POLYGAMY.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ix., p.&nbsp;246.)</p>

  <p>In answer to the various Queries of <i>Stylites</i> I have to
  observe:</p>

  <p>1. That the Jews do not at present, in any country, practise polygamy,
  it being contrary, not to the letter, but to the spirit of the law of
  Moses, which nevertheless provides for cases where a man has two wives at
  the same time; the inconvenience of which practice is several times
  pointed out, and which was also inconsistent with the Levirate law. (See
  Jahn, § 151.; and the Mishna, <span lang="he" class="heb" title="SDR NSHYM"
  ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5E1;&#x5D3;&#x5E8;
  &#x5E0;&#x5E9;&#x5D9;&#x5DD;</bdo></span>&#x200E;, which designates more
  wives than one <span lang="he" class="heb" title="TSRWT" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5E6;&#x5E8;&#x5D5;&#x5EA;</bdo></span>&#x200E;, <i>trouble,
  adversaries</i>.)</p>

  <p>2. The practice was, however, allowed expressly to the Jewish kings
  only, perhaps to the extent of <i>four</i> wives, which is the Rabbinic
  exposition, and coincides with the Koran.</p>

  <p>3. Marriage being a civil contract in most heathen countries, as also
  amongst the Jews and early Christians, polygamy is not forbidden or
  allowed on religious grounds. Marriage was included under the general
  head of covenants, <span lang="he" class="heb" title="KTWBWT" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5DB;&#x5EA;&#x5D5;&#x5D1;&#x5D5;&#x5EA;</bdo></span>&#x200E;,
  in the Mishna. Barbarous nations generally practised polygamy, according
  to Tacitus (<i>Germ.</i> 18.); excepting the Germans, who, like the
  Greeks and Romans, "were content with a single wife," although some
  exceptions were found in this respect, <i>non libidine, sed ob
  nobilitatem</i>.</p>

  <p>4. Polygamy was not practised amongst the early Christians, who
  followed the Jews in this matter.</p>

  <p>5. Clement of Alexandria (<i>Stromata</i>, lib. iii. p.&nbsp;461., edit.
  1629) says:</p>

  <p>Whence it appears that to have progeny and a helpmate at home were the
  objects proposed in matrimony, for which polygamy was unfavorable. He
  then remarks on the privilege conceded to some to form a second marriage,
  after the death of the first wife, which St. Paul forbids to a bishop,
  who was to be, in the <i>modern</i> sense of the word, a monogamist. Two
  wives at the same time were wholly repugnant to Jewish, as well as Greek
  and Roman, sentiment. Ignatius (<i>ad Polyc. 5.</i>) says it is
  <i>proper</i> (<span title="prepei" class="grk"
  >&pi;&rho;&#x1F73;&pi;&epsilon;&iota;</span>) for married persons to
  unite under the bishop's advice, so that the marriage may be <span
  title="kata Theon" class="grk">&kappa;&alpha;&tau;&#x1F70;
  &Theta;&epsilon;&#x1F78;&nu;</span> and not <span title="kat' epithumian" class="grk"
  >&kappa;&alpha;&tau;'
  &#x1F10;&pi;&iota;&theta;&upsilon;&mu;&#x1F77;&alpha;&nu;</span>; whence
  it is inferred that a marriage was <!-- Page 330 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page330"></a>{330}</span>valid in his time,
  although no religious sanction was obtained.</p>

  <p>It appears from Our Lord's remarks, Matt. xix. 8., Mark x. 5., that
  the consuetudinary law of marriage was not wholly abrogated, but was
  accommodated to the Jews by the Mosaic code. To understand this subject,
  therefore, the ancient usages and existing practices must be weighed, as
  well from ancient authors as from modern travellers. Whence it appears
  that the contract of marriage, whereby a man received a wife in
  consideration of a certain sum of money paid to her father, contemplated
  progeny as its special object.<a name="footnotetag5"
  href="#footnote5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> In default of an heir the Jew took a
  second wife, it being assumed that the physical defect was on the wife's
  part. If the second had no child he took a third, and in like default a
  fourth, which was the limit as understood by the rabbins, and is now the
  limit assigned by the Mahometan doctors. But the Mosaic law proceeded
  even beyond this, and allowed, on the husband's death, the right of
  <i>Iboom</i>, usually called the Levirate law, so that in case of there
  being <i>no</i> child, some <i>one</i> of the deceased's brothers had a
  right to take some <i>one</i> of the deceased's wives: and their progeny
  was deemed by the Mosaic code to be his deceased brother's, whose
  property indeed devolved in the line of such progeniture. It would appear
  that it was usual for the eldest brothers to marry, the younger brothers
  remaining single. This was a remnant, as modified by Moses, of the custom
  of polyandry, several brothers taking one wife,&mdash;a sort of necessary
  result of polygamy, since the number of males and females born is equal
  in all countries, within certain limits of variation. The best
  authorities on this subject are the Mishna, Selden, Du Halde, Niebuhr,
  Süsmilch, and Michälis, the last in Dr. Smith's translation, at the
  beginning of the 2nd volume.</p>

  <p>In the recent ceremony of the French emperor's marriage, money was
  presented to the bride.</p>

</div>
  <p><span class="sc">Stylites</span> says, "On what ground has polygamy
  become forbidden among Christians? I am not aware that it is directly
  forbidden by Scripture." In reply to this I venture to say, that the
  Divine will on this matter was sufficiently indicated at the creation,
  when one woman was appointed for one man, as expressed in Gen. ii. 24.,
  and quoted by Our Lord, with the significant addition of the word
  <i>twain</i>: "They twain shall be one flesh" (Matt. xix. 5.).
  <i>Twain</i>, i.e. two; not twenty, nor any indefinite number. Moreover,
  the law of nature speaks, in the nearly equal numbers of men and women
  that are born, or, as in this parish, by making the men the more
  numerous.</p>

  <p>But <span class="sc">Stylites</span> starts a most interesting
  question in a practical point of view. It is admitted that the Gospel is
  not very explicit respecting polygamy; and why so? Possibly the Gospel
  was purposely kept silent; and the Church allowed some latitude in
  judgment upon a very difficult point, because it was foreseen that the
  custom of polygamy would prove one of the greatest obstacles to a
  reception of pure Christianity. This difficulty is of constant occurrence
  in heathen lands at the present day. The Christian missionary insists
  upon the convert abandoning all his wives, except the one whom he first
  married. This woman was probably childless; and because she was so, he
  formed other and <i>legal</i> connexions. But before he can be received
  as a Christian, he must dissolve all these later ties, and bastardise
  children who were innocently born in lawful wedlock. The conditions are
  very awful. An act of cruelty and injustice has to be performed by one
  who is on the point of entering the threshold of Christianity!</p>

  <p>Perhaps these considerations may serve to account for the comparative
  silence of the Gospel upon a subject which seemed to require the
  expression of a direct command, whilst they will in no way obscure its
  universally-admitted meaning.</p>

<h3>"BEHEMOTH."</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ix., p.&nbsp;77.)</p>

  <p>Hobbes's <i>Behemoth</i> forms the eighth tract in the collection
  relating to the civil wars by the Baron Maseres (1815), and occupies
  nearly 200 pages. The Baron, in his Preface (pp. lxxviii., lxxix.) gives
  the following character of the work:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It is written in a very clear and lively style, and contains a great
  deal of curious historical matter concerning the rise and gradual
  increase of the Pope's power over temporal princes: the prohibition of
  marriage in secular priests; the doctrine of transubstantiation; the
  institution of auricular confession to a priest; the institution of
  Orders of preaching friars; and the institution of Universities and
  Schools of Disputation; (all which institutions, he observes, had a
  tendency to increase the power of the Pope, and were made for that
  purpose,) which is set forth in pp. 467, 468., &amp;c., to p.&nbsp;472. And
  much other interesting matter, concerning the sentiments of the
  Presbyterian ministers, the Papists, the Independents, and other
  sectaries. The pretensions made by them to Spiritual Power, and the
  nature of heresies and the history of them, is clearly and justly
  described in another part of it; over and above the narration of the
  several events of the civil war itself, which I believe to be faithful
  and exact in point of fact, though with a different judgment of Mr.
  Hobbes as to the moral merit of the persons concerned in producing them,
  from that which, I presume, will be formed by many of the readers of this
  history at this day; which difference of judgment between Mr. Hobbes and
  the present readers of this work, will be a necessary consequence, from
  Mr. Hobbes's having entertained two very important opinions concerning
  the nature of civil government in general, and of the monarchical
  government of England in particular, which in the present age are
  thought, by almost every Englishman who has paid any attention to the
  subject, to be exceedingly erroneous."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Subjoined to his reprint of this tract, the Baron has appended remarks
  on some particular passages therein, which appeared to him to contain
  erroneous opinions.</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>Photographic Slides for the Magic Lantern.</i>&mdash;Might not the
  collodion process be applied very usefully in the preparation of slides
  for the magic lantern?</p>

  <p>Good slides are always expensive, owing, in great measure, to the
  accuracy required, where every defect will be magnified some hundred
  times.</p>

  <p>I would suggest that a photographic picture should be taken on the
  glass plate, and then varnished. The painter should then apply his
  colours to the <i>opposite</i> side of the glass, using the photographic
  image as his outline. The colours would then be burnt in, and the varnish
  and collodion film cleared off.</p>

  <p>This plan would be especially useful when the photographic picture had
  been taken by the microscope.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Thos. Scott, B.A.</span></p>

  <p class="address">Brighton.</p>

  <p><i>Albumenized Paper.</i>&mdash;If <span class="sc">Mr. Hele</span>
  will follow the directions contained in a paper of mine which you
  published in Vol. ix., p.&nbsp;206., for albumenizing paper, I think he will
  have no reason to complain of waves, or streaks, or blotches, and will be
  saved the trouble of the damping process which he uses and recommends to
  others. ("N. &amp; Q.," Vol. ix., p.&nbsp;254.) I have done a considerable
  quantity of paper of Canson, both positive and negative, and also of
  other makers, Whatman, Turner, Sandford, and Nash, and in all I have
  succeeded perfectly in obtaining an even coating of albumen. I am
  convinced from my own experience that the cause of waviness, &amp;c., is
  due to raising the paper from the albumen <i>too slowly</i>. If the paper
  be snatched hastily from the solution, air bubbles no doubt will be
  formed; but if the paper be raised with a steady even motion, <i>not too
  slow</i>, the albumen will flow evenly from the paper, and it will dry
  with a perfectly even surface.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Shadbolt</span> is certainly mistaken in saying
  that positives printed from negatives will not stand a saturated solution
  of hypo. soda, unless they be printed so intensely dark that all traces
  of a picture by reflected light are obliterated. I have used nothing but
  a saturated solution for fixing my positives for a considerable time, and
  my experience agrees with that of other of your correspondents, that the
  picture is not as much reduced by a saturated solution as by a weaker
  one. By adding about one grain of sel d'or to every eight ounces of
  saturated solution, very rich black tones will be obtained.</p>

  <p>I inclose a specimen of what I have got in this way.</p>

  <p class="author">C. E. F.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[The specimen sent is most satisfactory; we wish that the locality of
  the view had been stated.&mdash;<span class="sc">Ed.</span>]</p>

</div>

  <p><i>Mounting Positives on Cardboard.</i>&mdash;In the absence of any
  other reply to J.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;S. (Vol. ix., p.&nbsp;282.), the following, as the method
  I always adopt, may serve his purpose.</p>

  <p>Having cut the positive to the size required, and trimmed the edges,
  place it upon the cardboard to which it is intended to be attached, and
  carefully centre it; then with a pencil make a slight dot at each of the
  angles. Remove the proof, and lay it <i>face downwards</i> upon a piece
  of clean paper or a cloth, and with any convenient brush smear it evenly
  over with a paste made of arrowroot, taking care not to have more than
  just enough to cover it without leaving any patches. Place it gently on
  the cardboard, holding it for the purpose by two <i>opposite</i> angles,
  and with a silk handkerchief dab it gently, beginning in the middle, and
  work any little superfluity of the paste towards the edges, when it will
  be gradually pressed out. The whole may be placed in a press, or under a
  pile of books to dry. <!-- Page 333 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page333"></a>{333}</span></p>

  <p>My object in using arrowroot is simply that of having a <i>pure
  starch</i> without colour, and it serves as a size to the paper, which
  has lost that originally in it by the repeated washings, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>The paste is made very thin, thus:&mdash;Put a teaspoonful of
  arrowroot (not <i>heaped</i>) into a teacup with about two spoonfuls of
  cold water, and mix into a paste: then add <i>boiling</i> water enough to
  fill the cup, and stir. Many photographers merely attach the <i>edges</i>
  of their pictures, but I prefer them to adhere all over. Gum is fatal to
  the beauty of a photograph, unless it is previously re-sized.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Geo. Shadbolt.</span></p>

  <p><i>Mr. Lyte's Collodion</i> (Vol. ix., p.&nbsp;225.).&mdash;Our readers may
  remember that in "N. &amp; Q.," Feb. 18, <span class="sc">Mr. F. Maxwell
  Lyte</span> furnished our readers with a detailed plan of his mode of
  preparing collodion. In that article, written from Pau, that gentleman
  was so good as to promise us that when he had an opportunity he would
  send us a couple of specimens of his workmanship. He has more than
  fulfilled his promise, for we have received from him this week four
  photographs, which, for general beauty and minuteness of detail, cannot
  be surpassed. The subjects are, I. Study of Trees, No. 2.; II. Study of
  Trees, No. 5. Old Pollard Oak; III. Study of Trees, Peasants collecting
  Leaves; IV. Old Church Porch, Morlâas, Monogram of the Eleventh Century.
  <span class="sc">Mr. Lyte</span>, who is a first-rate chemist, has shown
  himself by these specimens to be also a first-rate practical
  photographer. From him, therefore, the art may look for much future
  progress.</p>

  correct. The last letter of Henry VIII. was addressed to the Grand Master
  Pierre Du Pont, and not to Nicholas Cotoner, who ascended the Maltese
  throne in 1663. The translation of H.&nbsp;M.'s congratulatory letter to Du
  Pont, on his election, we trust you have already received. We referred in
  our former Note to a letter of Charles II., under date of "the last day
  of November, 1674," and since that came to our observation we have seen
  an <i>exact copy</i> bearing the autograph of the king. This circumstance
  leads us to inquire at what period, and with what English monarch, the
  custom of sending duplicate letters originated? In the time of James II.
  it would appear to have been followed, as one of H.&nbsp;M.'s letters is thus
  marked in his own handwriting.</p>

  <p>We would state, before closing this Note, that the letters of James
  II. are the earliest in date of any English royal letters filed away at
  this island which are <i>countersigned, or bear the address</i> of the
  Grand Master at the foot of the first page, on the left-hand side, as is
  customary in writing official letters to government officers at the
  present time.</p>

  <p>Will any of your correspondents kindly inform us with what English
  monarch the custom <!-- Page 334 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page334"></a>{334}</span>originated of having his letters
  countersigned by a minister, and of placing the address within the
  letter, as is the case in those of James II. to which we have just
  referred?</p>

  <p><i>Churchill's Grave</i> (Vol. ix., p.&nbsp;122.).&mdash;The fact that
  Churchill's grave is at Dover, is not an obscure one. It was visited by
  Byron, who wrote a poem on the subject, which will be found in his

  <p><i>Contributors to Knight's "Quarterly Magazine"</i> (Vol. ix.,
  p.&nbsp;103.).&mdash;I can answer one of E.&nbsp;H.'s inquiries. Gerard Montgomery
  was the assumed name of the Rev. J. Moultrie. It was originally adopted
  by him in that most brilliant of all school periodicals, <i>The
  Etonian</i>, and the mask was thrown off in the list of contributors
  given at the end of the third volume. In <i>The Etonian</i> it was
  attached to "Godiva," the poem which attracted the warm admiration of
  Gifford of the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, a man not prodigal of praise, and
  the "Godiva" of Moultrie may still fearlessly unveil its charms beside
  the "Godiva" of Tennyson. His longest poem in Knight's <i>Quarterly</i>
  was "La Belle Tryamour," which has since been republished in a volume of
  collected poems with his name to them, many of which are strikingly
  unlike it in character. The gay <i>Etonian</i> is now the vicar of Rugby;
  and the story of his experiences has been told by himself with a singular
  charm in his "Dream of a Life."</p>

  <p>Strange it is that the contributions of Macaulay to Knight's
  <i>Quarterly Magazine</i> should not, ere now, have been reprinted. Some
  few of them have been so, and are become familiar as household words on
  both sides of the Atlantic. The others are as obscure as if still in
  manuscript. What does the public at large know of the "Fragments of a
  Roman Tale," or the "Scenes from Athenian Revels;" in which the future
  historian tried his powers as a romancer and a dramatist&mdash;in the one
  case bringing before us Cæsar and Catiline, in the other Alcibiades and
  his comrades. There are essays too by Macaulay in Knight's <i>Quarterly
  Magazine</i> of a lighter character than those in the <i>Edinburgh
  Review</i>, but not less brilliant than any in that splendid series which
  now takes rank as one of the most valuable contributions of the present
  age to the standard literature of England. It would not be one of the
  least weighty arguments against the extended law of copyright, which
  Macaulay succeeded in passing, that the public is now deprived of the
  enjoyment of such treasures as these by the too nice fastidiousness of
  their author. As on two former occasions, we suppose that they are likely
  to be first collected in Boston or New York, and that London will
  afterwards profit by the rebound.</p>

  merely a conjecture, but may not the word <i>Pandras</i> be the second
  person singular in the future tense of a verb derived from the Latin
  <i>pando</i>, "to open?" I am not aware of the existence of such a word

  <p><i>Brissot de Warville</i> (Vol. ix., p.&nbsp;209.).&mdash;Since my last

  Brissot, &amp;c., written by himself</i>, an 8vo. volume of pp. 92,
  published by Debrett, London, 1794. It is a translation, the original of
  which I have never seen. And if you do not think the subject exhausted,
  perhaps you will spare a few lines for his own account of his name.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The office of an attorney was my gymnasium; I laboured in it for the
  space of five years, as well in the country as in Paris.... To relieve my
  weariness and disgust, I applied myself to literature and to the
  sciences. The study of the languages was, above all others, my favourite
  pursuit. Chance threw in my way two Englishmen, on a visit to my own
  country: I learned their language, and this circumstance decided my fate.
  It was at the commencement of my passion for that language that I made
  the metamorphosis of a diphthong in my name, which has been imputed to me
  as so great a crime; and, since I must render an account of every
  particular point, lest even the slightest hold against me should be
  afforded to malignity, I will declare the cause of the change in
  question. Born the thirteenth child of my family, and the second of my
  brothers in it, I bore, for the purpose of being distinguished from them,
  according to the custom of Beance, the name of a village in which my
  father <!-- Page 336 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page336"></a>{336}</span>possessed some landed property. This
  village was called Ouarville, and Ouarville became the name by which I
  was known in my own country. A fancy struck me that I would cast an
  English air over my name, and therefore I substituted, in the place of
  the French diphthong <i>ou</i>, the <i>w</i> of the English, which has
  the same sound. Since this nominal alteration, having put it as a
  signature to my published works and to different deeds, I judged it right
  to preserve it. If this be a crime, I participate in the guilt of the
  French <i>literati</i>, who, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,
  made no scruple whatsoever of <i>grecising</i> or (if we may use the
  expressions) <i>latinising</i> their appellations. <i>Arouet</i>, to
  escape from a reproachful pun upon his name, changed it into that of
  <i>Voltaire</i>. The <i>Anglomania</i> (if such it may be called) has
  occasioned me to alter mine; not, as it has been pretended, to draw in
  dupes, or to avoid passing for the son of my father, since I have
  perpetually borne, signed, and printed the name of my father after that
  second name which was given to me according to the custom of my
  country."</p>

  <p>I cannot at this moment refer particularly, but I know that the word
  is to be found in Burns' <i>Poems</i> in the sense of a rustic bit or
  bridle. The term is still in use in the west of Scotland; and country
  horses, within the memory of many, were tormented with the clumsy
  contrivance across their noses. With all its clumsiness it was very
  powerful, as it pressed on the nostrils of the animal: its action was
  somewhat like that of a pair of scissors.</p>

  second hereditary Butler of Ireland, was of age in 1220, and died, not in
  1230, but in 1248; that he married Roesia de Verdon; that his eldest son
  and heir was Theobald, third Butler (grandfather of Edmund, sixth Butler,
  who was created Earl of Carrick), and that by the same marriage he was
  also the ancestor of the Verdons of England and of Ireland. Now, in
  Lodge's <i>Peerage</i> by Archdall, 1789, vol. iv. p.&nbsp;5., it is said that
  the wife of Theobald, second Butler, was Joane, eldest sister and co-heir
  of John de Marisco, a great baron in Ireland; and thirdly, Sir Bernard
  Burke, in his <i>Extinct Peerage</i>, makes his wife to be Maud, sister
  of Thomas à Becket. Which of these three accounts am I to believe?</p>

  <p><i>Lord Harington (not Harrington)</i> (Vol. viii., p.&nbsp;366.).&mdash;In

  Hugh Courtenay, second Earl of Devon, born in 1303, had a daughter
  Catherine who married first, Lord Harington, and secondly, Sir Thomas
  Engain. This evidently must have been John, second Lord Harington, who
  died in 1363, and not William, fifth lord, as given in Burke: the fifth
  lord was not born till after 1384, and died in 1457.</p>

  <p><i>Amontillado</i> (Vol. ix., p.&nbsp;222.).&mdash;This wine was first
  imported into England about the year 1811, and the supply was so small,
  that the entire quantity was only sufficient for the table of three
  consumers, who speedily became attached to it, and thenceforward drank no
  other sherry. One of these was His Royal Highness the late Duke of Kent;
  and another, an old friend of one who now ventures from a distant
  recollection to give an account of its origin.</p>

  <p>The winegrowers at Xeres de la Frontera had been obliged, in
  consequence of the increasing demand for sherry, to extend their
  vineyards up the sides of the mountains, beyond the natural soil of the
  sherry grape. The produce thus obtained was mixed with the fruit of the
  more genial soil below, and a very good sherry for common use was the
  result.</p>

  <p>When the French devastated the neighbourhood of Xeres in 1809, they
  destroyed many of the vineyards, and for a time put the winegrowers to
  great shifts. One house in particular was obliged to have recourse
  chiefly to the mountain grape for the support of its trade, and for the
  first time manufactured it without admixture into wine. Very few butts of
  this produce would stand, and by far the greater portion was treated with
  brandy to make it saleable.</p>

  <p>The small quantity that resisted the acetous fermentation, turned out
  to be very different in flavour to the ordinary sherry wine, and it was
  sent over to this country under the name of Amontillado sherry, from the
  circumstance of the grape having been grown on the mountains.</p>

  <p>The genuine wine is very delicate, with a peculiar flavour, slightly
  aromatic rather than nutty; and answers admirably to the improved taste
  of the present age.</p>

  <p><i>Separation of the Sexes in Church</i> (Vol. ii., p.&nbsp;94.).&mdash;In

  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page337"></a>{337}</span>I speak, of
  course, of Roman Catholic churches; but I believe that in the Protestant
  congregations in France, the rule of the separation of the sexes has
  always been observed.</p>

  <p>In the island of Guernsey it has been usual, although the custom is
  now beginning to be broken through, for the men to communicate before the
  women. As the Presbyterian discipline was introduced into that island
  from France and Geneva, and prevailed there from the time of the
  Reformation until the Restoration of Charles II., it is probable that
  this usage is a remnant of the rule by which the sexes were separated
  during divine service.</p>

  <p><i>Costume of the Clergy not Enarean</i> (Vol. ix., p.101.).&mdash;A.
  C. M. has no other authority for calling the cassock and girdle of the

  for female attire," than the contrast to the close-fitting skin-tight
  fashion adopted by modern European tailors; the same might be said of any
  flowing kind of robe, such as the Eastern costume, or that of the English
  judges, which as nearly approaches to the cassock and cincture as
  possible. In a late number of the <i>Illustrated London News</i> will be
  found drawings from the new statues of the kings of England lately
  erected in the new Houses of Parliament: of, I think, twelve there
  represented, eight have a "petticoat-like cassock," or frock, and of
  course for convenience a girdle.</p>

  <p>Can any of your correspondents inform us when the cassock was
  introduced as an ecclesiastical dress, whether it was then worn by
  persons of other vocations, and what was the ecclesiastical costume (if

  address privately to any one, but being "unknown to fame," I prefer
  retaining in your pages the <i>incognito</i> I have assumed. I quite
  agree with the remarks of H.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;C. and <span class="sc">Mr. King</span>,

  <p><i>Grafts and the Parent Tree</i> (Vol. vii., pp. 365. 436. 486.
  536.).&mdash;I was equally surprised with H.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;K. at the dictum of <span
  class="sc">Mr. Ingleby</span>, that "grafts after some fifteen years wear
  themselves out," but the ground for such a belief is fairly suggested by
  J.&nbsp;G. (p. 536.), otherwise I am afraid the almost universal experience of
  orchardists would contradict <span class="sc">Mr. Ingleby's</span>
  theory. The "Ross Nonpareil," a well-known and valuable fruit, was, like
  the Ribston Pippin, singular to say, raised from Normandy seed. The fact
  has been often told to me by a gentleman who died several years since, at
  a very advanced age, in the town of New Ross, co. Wexford. He perfectly
  remembered the original tree standing in the garden attached to the
  endowed school in that town, where it had been originally planted by Sir
  John Ivory, the son or grandson of a Cromwellian settler, who raised it
  from seed, at the commencement of the eighteenth century; and who left
  his own dwelling-house in New Ross to be a school, and endowed it out of
  his estates. The tree has long since decayed, but its innumerable
  <i>grafted</i> successors are in the most flourishing condition. The
  flavour of this apple lies chiefly in its rind.</p>

  <p><i>Golden Tooth</i> (Vol. viii., p.&nbsp;382.).&mdash;I recollect very
  well, when a boy, trying to keep my tongue out of the cavity from whence
  a tooth had been extracted, in the hope of acquiring the golden tooth
  promised to me by my old nurse, and after several attempts having
  succeeded in refraining for four-and-twenty hours (the period required to
  elapse), and no gold tooth appearing, I well remember my disgust and
  disappointment. This <!-- Page 338 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page338"></a>{338}</span>folk lore (query <i>lure</i>) was, and I
  believe still is, in full force in the south of Ireland, and probably
  elsewhere.</p>

  <p><i>Cambridge Mathematical Questions</i> (Vol. ix.,
  p.&nbsp;35.).&mdash;These are so far put forth "by authority" as the
  publication in the Cambridge <i>Calendar</i>, and the two local
  newspapers goes; a collection of the Senate House Papers for "Honours"
  from 1838 to 1849, has also been published, arranged according to
  subjects, by Rev. A.&nbsp;H. Frost, M.A., of St. John's College.</p>

  <p><i>Lichfield Bower or Wappenschau</i> (Vol. ix., p.&nbsp;242.).&mdash;In
  answer to <span class="sc">Mr. Lamont's</span> question, I have to inform
  him that in this city a similar <i>wappenschau</i>, or exhibition of
  arms, has been annually maintained, with a short intermission, from time
  immemorial. The Court of Array held on Whit Monday was anciently
  commenced, according to Pitt, by the high constables of this city,
  attended by ten men with firelocks, and adorned with ribbons, preceded by
  eight morris-dancers, and a clown fantastically dressed, escorting the
  sheriff, town clerk, and bailiffs from the Guildhall to the Bower at
  Greenhill, temporarily erected for their reception, where the names of
  all the householders and others of the twenty-one wards of the city were
  called to do suit and service to "the court of review of men and arms."
  The dozener, or petty constable of each ward, was summoned to attend, who
  with a flag joined the procession through his ward, when a volley was
  fired over every house in it, and the procession was regaled by the
  inhabitants with refreshments. Those inhabitants who, on such summons,
  proceeded to the Bower, were regaled with a cold collation. Those who did
  not attend (for the names of each ward were called over) were fined one
  penny each. The twenty-one wards require a long day for this purpose, and
  it is concluded by a procession to the market-place, where the town clerk
  informs them that the firm allegiance of their ancestors had obtained
  grants to their city of valuable charters and immunities, and advises
  them to continue in the same course. The dozeners then deposit their
  flags under the belfry in the adjacent church of St. Mary's. This
  ceremony still continues, with the exception of the armed men and the
  firing.</p>

  <p><i>Anecdote of George IV.</i> (Vol. ix., p.&nbsp;244.).&mdash;In the letter
  supposed to be written by the late Prince of Wales when a child, I
  observe these words: "which have stolen from the old woman (the queen)."
  I think it more probable that the writer refers to Mrs. Schwellenberg, an
  old German lady, who came over with the late queen as a confidential
  domestic, and who would have such articles under her keeping. (See
  <i>Diary of Madame D'Arblay</i>.) The transaction is a notable instance
  of the prince's forethought and liberality at an early age.</p>

  their rarity is undoubted; but I should like to be informed by W.&nbsp;R., or
  any other person who has paid particular attention to the natural history
  of this useful and much calumniated domestic animal, whether yellow
  female cats are not quite as uncommon as tortoiseshell males?</p>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</h3>

  <p>The new edition of Mr. Smee's valuable little work on <i>The Eye in
  Health and Disease</i>, is one to which we desire to direct the attention
  of all our readers, for the subject is one of great importance, and more
  especially to reading men. Mr. Smee has obviously devoted great attention
  to the various derangements to which this hardly-worked yet
  beautifully-delicate organ is liable; and his remarks cannot fail to
  prove of great service to those who require the assistance either of the
  oculist or the optician. To our photographic readers, the present reprint
  will be of especial interest for the very able paper "<i>On the
  Stereoscope and Binocular Perspective</i>," which is appended to it.</p>

  <p><i>The Homeric Design of the Shield of Achilles</i>, by William
  Watkiss Lloyd. A dissertation on a subject immortalised by the poetry of
  Homer and the sculpture of Flaxman, which will well repay our classical
  readers for the time spent in its perusal.</p>

  <p><i>Architectural Botany, setting forth the Geometrical Distribution of
  Foliage, Flowers, Fruit</i>, &amp;c.&mdash;a separately published extract
  from Mr. W.&nbsp;P. Griffith's <i>Ancient Gothic Churches</i>&mdash;is a
  farther endeavour on the part of the author to direct attention to the
  laws by which vegetable productions were created and imitated by the
  early architects, and thereby to contribute to securing greater beauty
  and precision on the part of their successors to the decoration of
  churches.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Books Received.</span>&mdash;<i>Gibbon's Decline and
  Fall of the Roman Empire, with Notes by Milman and Guizot, edited by</i>
  Dr. William Smith. The second volume of this handsome edition, forming

  Claudius to Julian's victories in Gaul.&mdash;<i>The Archæologia

  an excellent article by Mr. Hartshorne on Conway Castle, a number of
  other papers on subjects connected with the Principality.&mdash;<i>Lives
  of the Queens of England</i>, by Agnes Strickland, Vol. IV., is entirely
  dedicated to Glorious Queen Bess, of whom we think far more highly than
  her biographer.&mdash;<i>Poetical Works of William Cowper</i>, edited by
  Robert Bell, Vol. I. Cowper is so great and deserved a favourite, that
  his works will probably be among the most popular portion of Parker's
  <i>Annotated Edition of the English Poets</i>.&mdash;<i>The Journal of
  Sacred Literature</i>, New Series, No. XI., April 1854, contains thirteen
  various articles illustrative of the Sacred Writings, besides its
  valuable miscellaneous correspondence and
  intelligence.&mdash;<i>Macaulay's Critical and Historical Essays.</i>
  Part II. of the People's Edition contains for one shilling some six or
  seven of these brilliant essays, including those on Moore's Byron,
  Boswell's Johnson, Nugent's Hampden, and Burleigh.&mdash;The
  <i>Cyclopædia Bibliographica</i>, Part XIX. The first portion of this
  valuable work must be drawing rapidly to a close, as this nineteenth part
  extends to Rev. R. Valpy.</p>
